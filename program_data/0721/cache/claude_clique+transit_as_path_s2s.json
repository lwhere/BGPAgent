Generally, an AS with a much higher transit degree is likely to be the provider of the AS with a lower transit degree in a given AS pair along the path. Since the transit degrees consistently decrease along the path (with the exception of 174 which is likely a tier-1 provider), the relationships are inferred to be p2c (provider to customer) between each consecutive AS pair.",
