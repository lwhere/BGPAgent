So, the relationship is p2c (provider-to-customer).\n2. 132876-174: Similar to the previous step, 132876 is likely to be a provider to 174, given their transit degree difference. So, the relationship is p2c.\n3. 174-1273: Both 174 and 1273 have relatively high transit degrees (6732 and 279, respectively). This suggests a peer-to-peer relationship, as they are likely to be exchanging traffic on an equal footing. So, the relationship is p2p.\n4. 1273-7552: 1273 has a much higher transit degree than 7552, indicating that 1273 is likely to be a provider to 7552. So, the relationship is p2c.\n5. 7552-4637: Similar to the previous step, 7552 is likely to be a customer of 4637, given their transit degree difference. So, the relationship is p2c.\n6. 4637-3356: 4637 has a higher transit degree than 3356, suggesting that 4637 is a provider to 3356. So, the relationship is p2c.\n7. 3356-50629: 3356 has a much higher transit degree than 50629, indicating that 3356 is likely to be a provider to 50629.
