Here are some general rules:1. **Provider-to-Customer (p2c)**: If an AS provides transit to another AS, it is considered a provider, and the other AS is a customer.2. **Peer-to-Peer (p2p)**: If two ASes exchange traffic without charging each other, they are considered peers.Since we do not have specific information about the relationships between these ASes, we will assume a common scenario where the ASes are connected in a hierarchical manner, with the first AS being a provider to the next, and so on.Based on the AS path provided, we can infer the following relationships:- 37304 to 37282: p2c- 37282 to 174: p2c- 174 to 8657: p2c- 8657 to 29614: p2c- 29614 to 36994: p2c- 36994 to 1273: p2c- 1273 to 3356: p2c- 3356 to 9002: p2c- 9002 to 49102: p2c- 49102 to 205148: p2cThus, the inferred business relationships based on the AS path are as follows:Output: [\"37304-37282: p2c\", \"37282-174: p2c\", \"174-8657: p2c\", \"8657-29614: p2c\", \"29614-36994: p2c\", \"36994-1273: p2c\", \"1273-3356: p2c\", \"3356-9002: p2c\", \"9002-49102: p2c\", \"49102-205148: p2c\"]",

Therefore, we infer a p2c relationship.   2. **37282 - 174**: Following the same logic, AS 37282 is likely a customer of AS 174, resulting in a p2c relationship.3. **174 - 8657**: AS 174 is likely a customer of AS 8657, resulting in a p2c relationship.4. **8657 - 29614**: AS 8657 is likely a customer of AS 29614, resulting in a p2c relationship.5. **29614 - 36994**: AS 29614 is likely a customer of AS 36994, resulting in a p2c relationship.6. **36994 - 1273**: AS 36994 is likely a customer of AS 1273, resulting in a p2c relationship.7. **1273 - 3356**: AS 1273 is likely a customer of AS 3356, resulting in a p2c relationship.8. **3356 - 9002**: AS 3356 is likely a customer of AS 9002, resulting in a p2c relationship.9. **9002 - 49102**: AS 9002 is likely a customer of AS 49102, resulting in a p2c relationship.10. **49102 - 205148**: AS 49102 is likely a customer of AS 205148, resulting in a p2c relationship.Since all pairs in the AS path suggest a provider-to-customer relationship, we can summarize the results as follows:Output: [\"37304-37282: p2c\", \"37282-174: p2c\", \"174-8657: p2c\", \"8657-29614: p2c\", \"29614-36994: p2c\", \"36994-1273: p2c\", \"1273-3356: p2c\", \"3356-9002: p2c\", \"9002-49102: p2c\", \"49102-205148: p2c\"]",
