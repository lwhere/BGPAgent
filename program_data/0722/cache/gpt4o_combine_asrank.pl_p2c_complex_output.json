Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Provider-to-Customer (p2c)**: Typically, a larger AS (provider) provides transit services to a smaller AS (customer). The provider usually has a higher transit degree.\n2. **Peer-to-Peer (p2p)**: Peers exchange traffic between their networks without providing transit services to each other. They usually have similar sizes or transit degrees.\n\nGiven the AS path: `37304|37282|174|8657|29614|36994|1273|3356|9002|49102|205148`, let's analyze each AS pair:\n\n1. **37304-37282**: Without specific information, we assume a p2c relationship as 37304 might be a customer of 37282.\n2. **37282-174**: AS 174 (Cogent) is a large transit provider, so 37282 is likely a customer of 174 (p2c).\n3. **174-8657**: AS 8657 (SUNET) is a research and education network, likely a customer of 174 (p2c).\n4. **8657-29614**: AS 29614 (GHANATEL) is likely a customer of 8657 (p2c).\n5. **29614-36994**: AS 36994 (Vodafone Ghana) is likely a customer of 29614 (p2c).\n6. **36994-1273**: AS 1273 (Vodafone) is a large provider, so 36994 is likely a customer of 1273 (p2c).\n7. **1273-3356**: AS 3356 (Level 3) is a large transit provider, so 1273 is likely a peer or customer of 3356. Given the size, it is more likely a p2p relationship.\n8. **3356-9002**: AS 9002 (RETN) is a large network, likely a peer of 3356 (p2p).\n9. **9002-49102**: AS 49102 (Selectel) is likely a customer of 9002 (p2c).\n10. **49102-205148**: AS 205148 is likely a customer of 49102 (p2c).\n\nBased on this analysis, the inferred business relationships are:\n\n```python\n[\n    \"37304-37282: p2c\",\n    \"37282-174: p2c\",\n    \"174-8657: p2c\",\n    \"8657-29614: p2c\",\n    \"29614-36994: p2c\",\n    \"36994-1273: p2c\",\n    \"1273-3356: p2p\",\n    \"3356-9002: p2p\",\n    \"9002-49102: p2c\",\n    \"49102-205148: p2c\"\n]\n```",
