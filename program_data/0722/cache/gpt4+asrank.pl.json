This could be a p2c relationship if 1273 is providing transit to 7552.\n5. **7552-4637**: AS4637 (Telstra) is another large network. This could be a p2p relationship if they are peering.\n6. **4637-3356**: AS3356 (Level 3, now part of Lumen) is a major transit provider. This is likely a p2c relationship with 4637 being the customer.\n7. **3356-50629**: AS50629 could be a smaller network or regional ISP. This is likely a p2c relationship with 50629 being the customer.\n8. **50629-206499**: Without specific information, this could be either p2c or p2p. Assuming 50629 is larger, this might be a p2c relationship.\n9. **206499-202365**: Similarly, this could be either p2c or p2p. Assuming 206499 is larger, this might be a p2c relationship.\n\n### Inferred Business Relationships:\n\nBased on the above analysis, the inferred business relationships are:\n\n1. 136255-132876: p2c\n2. 132876-174: p2c\n3. 174-1273: p2p\n4. 1273-7552: p2c\n5. 7552-4637: p2p\n6. 4637-3356: p2c\n7. 3356-50629: p2c\n8. 50629-206499: p2c\n9. 206499-202365: p2c\n\n### Output:\n\n```python\n[\n    \"136255-132876: p2c\",\n    \"132876-174: p2c\",\n    \"174-1273: p2p\",\n    \"1273-7552: p2c\",\n    \"7552-4637: p2p\",\n    \"4637-3356: p2c\",\n    \"3356-50629: p2c\",\n    \"50629-206499: p2c\",\n    \"206499-202365: p2c\"\n]\n```\n\nThis output provides a list of inferred business relationships between each AS pair in the given AS path.",
