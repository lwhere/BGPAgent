Given their sizes and scopes, I infer a p2p (peer-to-peer) relationship between them.\n\n3. 6830 - 21217: 21217 is a smaller ISP, and 6830 is a larger one. I infer a p2c (provider-to-customer) relationship, where 6830 is the provider and 21217 is the customer.\n\n4. 21217 - 4134: 4134 is a relatively small ISP, and 21217 is also a smaller ISP. Given their sizes, I infer a p2p (peer-to-peer) relationship between them.\n\n5. 4134 - 174: 174 is a large ISP (ASN of Cogent Communications), and 4134 is a smaller ISP. I infer a p2c (provider-to-customer) relationship, where 174 is the provider and 4134 is the customer.\n\nHere's the output list of inferred business relationships:\n\n[\"396862-22773: p2c\", \"22773-6830: p2p\", \"6830-21217: p2c\", \"21217-4134: p2p\", \"4134-174: p2c\"]\n\nPlease note that these inferences are based on my analysis and might not be 100% accurate, as the lack of information from the ASrank algorithm limits the confidence in these conclusions.",

So, the relationship is p2c (provider-to-customer).\n2. 21217 - 4134: 21217 is likely to be a customer of 4134, as it is further down the AS path. So, the relationship is p2c (provider-to-customer).\n3. 4134 - 174: 4134 is likely to be a customer of 174, as it is further down the AS path. So, the relationship is p2c (provider-to-customer).\n\nOutput:\n[\"13237-21217: p2c\", \"21217-4134: p2c\", \"4134-174: p2c\"]\n\nPlease note that without additional information, such as clique or transit degree, the inference might not be exact.
