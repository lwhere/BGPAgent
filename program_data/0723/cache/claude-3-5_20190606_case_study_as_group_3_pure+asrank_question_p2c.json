We assume that AS relationships generally follow the valley-free property, where traffic flows up to a provider, then horizontally to a peer, and then down to customers.\n2. The rightmost AS (174) appears to be a tier-1 provider in all paths, so relationships leading to it are likely p2c.\n3. AS 4134 and 21217 appear consistently in the same order across multiple paths, suggesting a p2c relationship.\n4. The relationship between 12956 and 6830 is inferred as p2p because they both appear to be large transit providers.\n5. For other relationships, we assume p2c as the default when there's no strong evidence for a p2p relationship.\n\nPlease note that these inferences are based on limited information and may not be 100% accurate without additional data such as AS sizes, transit degrees, or known tier-1 providers.",

This is likely correct given that both are large transit providers.\n\n2. 6830-21217: ASrank suggests a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1).

The repeated appearance of the sequence 25091|21217|4134|174|1403 in all three paths suggests this is likely the core of the route, with 4134 and 174 possibly being large tier-1 providers.\n3. The relationship between 4134 and 174 is inferred as peer-to-peer (p2p) because they appear to be of similar size and importance in the paths.\n4. For most other adjacent AS pairs, we infer a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship, with the AS on the left being the provider and the one on the right being the customer.\n5. Without more specific information about the ASes involved, we make these inferences based on their positions in the paths and the valley-free principle.\n\nPlease note that these inferences are based on limited information and may not always reflect the actual relationships.

The relationships at the edge of the paths (e.g., 5605-25091, 48946-9002, 262730-10429) are likely p2c, as these are probably smaller ASes connecting to larger transit providers.\n\n2. The core of the path (4134-174) is likely a p2p relationship, as these are both large transit providers.\n\n3. The relationship between 21217 and 4134 is inferred as p2p because 21217 appears in multiple paths, suggesting it's a significant transit provider.\n\n4. The relationships 174-15935 and 15935-29504 are likely p2c, as they're towards the end of the path, suggesting a transition to smaller networks.\n\n5. The relationship between 12956 and 6830 is inferred as p2p, as both appear to be large transit providers.\n\nPlease note that these inferences are based on limited information and the actual relationships may vary.

Similarly, the relationship between 4134 and 174 is likely peer-to-peer (p2p) as they are always at the end of the paths, suggesting they are both large networks.\n4.

The repetition of some AS numbers (like 25091, 21217, 4134, 174) in multiple paths suggests they are larger networks, more likely to be providers in p2c relationships.\n\n5. Some relationships, particularly between less well-known ASes, are inferred based on their position in the path and the general tendency for p2c relationships to be more common than p2p.\n\n6.

AS6830 (Liberty Global) is a large provider, and its position in the paths suggests it's providing transit to AS21217.\n\n5. AS4637 (Telstra) is also a large provider, and its relationship with AS6830 is likely peer-to-peer (p2p) given their sizes and positions in the path.\n\n6.

The relationships between adjacent ASes in the middle of the path (e.g., 6830-21217-4134-174) are likely to be provider-to-customer (p2c) relationships, as these are probably large transit providers.\n\n3. The relationship between 4637-6830 and 4134-174 is inferred as peer-to-peer (p2p) because these are likely large tier-1 or tier-2 providers that peer with each other.\n\n4. The relationships at the edges of the paths (e.g., 204957-64010, 28885-8529, 34164-1273) are likely provider-to-customer (p2c) relationships, as smaller ASes typically connect to larger providers.\n\n5. We assume that relationships are consistent across different paths, so we use the same inferred relationships when ASes appear in multiple paths.\n\nPlease note that these inferences are based on common patterns in AS relationships and the valley-free principle.

Given 4134's large size and position in the paths, this seems accurate.\n\n3. 21217-6830: The ASrank algorithm indicates a customer-to-provider (c2p) relationship (-1), with 6830 being the provider. This aligns with 6830's position in the paths and its connections to other large networks.\n\n4. 6830-12956, 6830-20804, 6830-32934: The ASrank algorithm suggests p2p relationships (0) for these pairs.

The relationship between 23844 and 24138 is likely p2c (provider-to-customer) as 23844 appears at the beginning of the path, suggesting it's a smaller AS.\n\n2. The relationships continue as p2c down the path until we reach 4134 and 174. These are both large tier-1 providers, so their relationship is likely p2p (peer-to-peer).\n\n3. After 174, the relationships are again inferred as p2c, as 174 (Cogent) is a large global provider and likely provides transit to the subsequent ASes.\n\n4. The pattern repeats in all three paths, with 174 being the pivotal AS where the relationship changes.\n\nPlease note that these inferences are based on typical BGP relationship patterns and the position of ASes in the path. More accurate determinations would require additional data such as AS size, transit degrees, or known tier-1 provider information.",

Most relationships are inferred as provider-to-customer (p2c) because in typical AS paths, traffic usually flows from smaller to larger providers.\n\n2. The relationship between 4134 and 174 is inferred as peer-to-peer (p2p) because both are large, global providers (China Telecom and Cogent) that are likely to peer with each other.\n\n3. Repeated patterns across multiple paths (e.g., 25091-21217-4134-174) strengthen the confidence in these relationship inferences.\n\n4. The last ASes in the paths (174 in the first path, 29504 in the others) are likely to be the destination networks, and their relationships with the previous AS are typically customer-to-provider (reverse of p2c).\n\nPlease note that these inferences are based solely on the given AS paths and common BGP relationship patterns.

AS174 (Cogent) and AS4134 (China Telecom) are both large global providers, so their relationship is likely peer-to-peer (p2p).\n\n3. AS21217 appears to be a customer of both AS6830 and AS4134 in different paths, suggesting it's a smaller network.\n\n4. The relationships near the edge of the paths (beginning and end) are more likely to be provider-to-customer (p2c) as they often represent connections to smaller, more specific networks.\n\n5. Large transit providers like AS6830 (Liberty Global) and AS12956 (Telefonica) are more likely to have peer-to-peer (p2p) relationships with each other.\n\n6. Without more specific information about the size and nature of some of the ASes, I've made educated guesses based on their position in the path and the valley-free principle.\n\nPlease note that these inferences are based on limited information and the actual relationships may vary.

The relationships at the beginning of each path (e.g., 25325-34156, 28246-61832, 21342-20940) are likely p2c, as smaller ASes typically connect to larger providers.\n\n4. 12956-6830 is inferred as p2p because both appear to be large transit providers in the middle of the path.\n\n5.

Given that both AS174 (Cogent) and AS4134 (China Telecom) are large global providers, a p2p relationship is very likely.\n\n2. 4134-21217: The ASrank algorithm shows a -1 relationship for 21217-4134, which typically indicates a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship with 4134 as the provider. This aligns with China Telecom (4134) being a large global provider.\n\n3. 21217-25091: The ASrank algorithm shows a -1 relationship for 25091-21217, suggesting a p2c relationship with 25091 as the provider.\n\n4. 25091-5483: The ASrank algorithm shows a 0 relationship, suggesting a p2p relationship.\n\n5. 25091-6663: The ASrank algorithm shows a 0 relationship, suggesting a p2p relationship.\n\n6. 5483-41852: The ASrank algorithm shows a 0 relationship, suggesting a p2p relationship.\n\n7. 6663-51799: The ASrank algorithm shows a 0 relationship, suggesting a p2p relationship.\n\nFor the remaining relationships not directly inferred by the ASrank algorithm, I'll make educated guesses based on the AS path and typical Internet hierarchy:\n\n8. 61832-52936: Likely a p2c relationship with 61832 as the provider, as 52936 appears at the edge of the path.\n\n9. 12956-61832: Likely a p2c relationship with 12956 as the provider, as 12956 (Telefonica) is a large global provider.\n\n10. 6830-12956: Likely a p2p relationship, as both are large providers.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the list of inferred business relationships:\n\n[\"174-4134: p2p\",\n\"4134-21217: p2c\",\n\"21217-25091: c2p\",\n\"25091-5483: p2p\",\n\"25091-6663: p2p\",\n\"5483-41852: p2p\",\n\"6663-51799: p2p\",\n\"61832-52936: p2c\",\n\"12956-61832: p2c\",\n\"6830-12956: p2p\"]",

AS174 (Cogent) is a Tier 1 provider, so its relationship with AS4134 (China Telecom) is likely p2p.\n4. The repeated pattern of 6830|21217|4134|174 in the first two paths suggests a consistent relationship between these ASes.\n5. Without more specific information about the ASes involved, we assume the general pattern of p2c relationships, with the exception of the last hop to the Tier 1 provider.\n\nPlease note that these inferences are based on general patterns and might not always reflect the exact real-world relationships.

The relationships towards the end of the paths (21217-4134-174) are likely to be between large transit providers. I've inferred 21217-4134 as p2c and 4134-174 as p2p, as AS174 (Cogent) is known to be a Tier 1 provider.\n\n2. The beginning of each path likely represents smaller ASes connecting to progressively larger ones, hence the p2c relationships.\n\n3. In the first path, 4637-6830 is inferred as p2p because both appear to be large networks in the middle of the path.\n\n4. The relationship 25091-21217 is consistent across two paths, suggesting 21217 is a larger provider.\n\nPlease note that these are inferences based on limited information.

AS6830 appears to be a large transit provider, as it's present in all three paths and connects to multiple other ASes.\n4. The relationships are mostly inferred as p2c because the ASes on the left are likely smaller networks connecting to larger transit providers on their right.\n\nNote that without additional information like AS size, transit degrees, or known tier-1 ASes, these inferences are based on the typical valley-free routing principle and the relative positions of ASes in the paths.

The relationships at the beginning of each path (e.g., 263309-263311, 24358-4538, 6786-6724) are likely p2c as these are probably smaller ASes connecting to larger providers.\n2. The relationship between 6830 and 21217 is inferred as p2c because 6830 appears in multiple paths before joining the common part, suggesting it's a large provider.\n3. The relationships between 21217, 4134, and 174 are inferred as p2p because these appear to be large transit providers that are likely to peer with each other.\n4. The last few hops (174-15935-29504) are inferred as p2c relationships, assuming 29504 is the destination AS and is likely smaller than the transit providers.\n\nPlease note that these inferences are based on the limited information provided in the AS paths and may not always reflect the actual relationships.

The relationships are mostly inferred as provider-to-customer (p2c) because AS paths typically follow a valley-free pattern, where a customer AS connects to its provider.\n\n2. The relationship between 21217 and 4134 is inferred as peer-to-peer (p2p) because these ASes appear in the middle of multiple paths, suggesting they might be exchanging traffic on equal terms.\n\n3. Similarly, the relationship between 4134 and 174 is inferred as peer-to-peer (p2p) for the same reason - they appear consistently in the middle of the paths.\n\n4. The last few hops in each path (174|15935|29504) are consistently present, suggesting a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship chain.\n\nPlease note that these inferences are based solely on the given AS paths and may not reflect the actual relationships.

The relationship between 6830 and 21217 is inferred as p2p because it appears consistently in the middle of the paths, suggesting they might be peers.\n4. The relationship between 4134 and 174 is inferred as p2p because they are large networks often seen peering with each other.\n5. When the same pair appears multiple times, the relationship is kept consistent across all instances.\n\nPlease note that without additional information about the ASes (such as their size, transit degrees, or known tier classifications), these inferences are based on general BGP routing principles and may not be 100% accurate in all cases.",

Here's the analysis:\n\n1. 8871|25061|25091|21217|4134|174\n2. 201387|8953|25091|21217|4134|174\n3. 52876|262561|263047|12956|6830|21217|4134|174|20485|24811|49673\n\nAnalyzing these paths, we can infer the following relationships:\n\n[\"8871-25061: p2c\", \"25061-25091: p2c\", \"25091-21217: p2c\", \"21217-4134: p2c\", \"4134-174: p2p\",\n\"201387-8953: p2c\", \"8953-25091: p2c\",\n\"52876-262561: p2c\", \"262561-263047: p2c\", \"263047-12956: p2c\", \"12956-6830: p2p\", \"6830-21217: p2c\", \"174-20485: p2c\", \"20485-24811: p2c\", \"24811-49673: p2c\"]\n\nExplanation:\n1. We assume that AS relationships generally follow a hierarchical structure, with smaller ASes connecting to larger ones as customers.\n2. The relationship between 4134 and 174 is likely p2p as they are both large tier-1 providers.\n3. The relationship between 12956 and 6830 is also likely p2p as they are both large international providers.\n4. For most other relationships, we assume a p2c relationship where the AS on the left is the customer of the AS on the right.\n5. The last part of the third path (174|20485|24811|49673) shows a clear hierarchical structure, likely representing p2c relationships.\n\nPlease note that these inferences are based on typical AS relationship patterns and the given paths. Real-world relationships might be more complex and may require additional information for more accurate determinations.",
