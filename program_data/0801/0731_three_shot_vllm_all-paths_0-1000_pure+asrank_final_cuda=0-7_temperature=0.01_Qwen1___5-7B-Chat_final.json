They are likely peers, exchanging traffic on a peering basis, as they have similar roles in the industry.\n\n2. **206499 - 34549**: AS34549 (Vodafone) is a major mobile network operator. Given AS206499's presence, it's possible that AS34549 is a customer of AS206499, as Vodafone often establishes peering relationships with their international service providers.\n\n3. **34549 - 6461**: AS6461 (Abovenet Communications) is another telecommunications company, potentially a competitor or a smaller provider. The relationship between AS34549 and AS6461 could be either p2c (provider-to-customer) or p2p, depending on their specific agreements and roles in the market.\n\n4. **6461 - 26677**: AS26677 (Vodafone) is again a mobile network operator, which could be a customer of AS6461, given their shared history and the nature of their business.\n\n5. **26677 - 11700**: AS11700 (Telenor) is another mobile network operator. The relationship between AS26677 and AS11700 is likely p2c, as Telenor is a customer of Vodafone, which in turn is a customer of AS6461.\n\nBased on this analysis, the business relationships in the AS path are:\n- **202365-206499: p2p**\n- **206499-34549: p2c**\n- **34549-6461: p2c (or p2p, depending on their specific arrangement)** \n- **6461-26677: p2c**\n- **26677-11700: p2c**\n\nOutput:\n[\"202365-206499: p2p\", \"206499-34549: p2c\", \"34549-6461: p2c/p2p\", \"6461-26677: p2c\", \"26677-11700: p2c\"]",

It's likely that AS1273 is a customer of AS3356, as Vodafone might also purchase transit services from Cable & Wireless.\n\n3. **1273 - 12430**: AS12430 (Telenor) is a Norwegian telecommunications company. Given that AS1273 is a large network, it's possible that AS12430 is a customer of AS1273, as Telenor might be a customer of Vodafone.\n\n4. **12430 - 6739**: AS6739 (Telia Norge) is another Norwegian telecommunications company. The relationship between AS12430 and AS6739 is less clear, but it could be a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship, as both are Norwegian operators and might have peering agreements to optimize their traffic exchange.\n\nBased on these observations, the inferred business relationships are:\n\n- **13830-3356: p2c (provider-to-customer)** (Level 3 providing transit to Cable & Wireless)\n- **3356-1273: p2c (provider-to-customer)** (Cable & Wireless providing transit to Vodafone)\n- **1273-12430: p2c (provider-to-customer)** (Vodafone providing transit to Telenor)\n- **12430-6739: p2p (peer-to-peer)** (Telenor and Telia Norge, likely having peering agreements)\n\nOutput: [\"13830-3356: p2c\", \"3356-1273: p2c\", \"1273-12430: p2c\", \"12430-6739: p2p\"]",

This suggests a potential peering relationship, but the direction is not clear. It could be either AS3356 providing to 1273 or vice versa.\n\n3. 1273 - 12430:\nThe ASrank algorithm suggests a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1).

AS6939 (Cable & Wireless) is a UK-based telecommunications company. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS55720 providing transit services to AS6939.\n\n2. **6939 to 3356**: AS6939 is a customer of AS3356 (Vodafone Group). This is a common practice for smaller regional networks to access larger transit providers.\n\n3. **3356 to 209**: AS3356, being a regional network, is likely a customer of AS209 (Vodafone Group, another division). This is another instance of a p2c relationship, with AS3356 seeking transit services from its own parent company.\n\n4. **209 to 4297**: AS209, another division of Vodafone Group, is again a customer of AS4297 (Vodafone Group's international carrier). This is consistent with the company's structure and the practice of providing services to its own subsidiaries.\n\n5. **4297 to 4155**: AS4297, a carrier for Vodafone Group, is likely a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship, as it's exchanging traffic with AS4155, another carrier within the Vodafone Group. This is common for carriers within the same organization to establish peering relationships.\n\nBased on this analysis, the business relationships in the AS path are:\n- **55720-6939: p2c**\n- **6939-3356: p2c**\n- **3356-209: p2c**\n- **209-4297: p2c**\n- **4297-4155: p2p**\n\nOutput:\n[\"55720-6939: p2c\", \"6939-3356: p2c\", \"3356-209: p2c\", \"209-4297: p2c\", \"4297-4155: p2p\"]",

AS65511 (Verizon Business) is likely a transit provider or a customer of Level 3. This suggests a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship.\n\n2. **65511 - 140096**: AS140096 (AT&T) is another major telecommunications company, which could be a transit provider or a customer of AS65511. The relationship here is likely provider-to-customer (p2c) as well.\n\n3. **140096 - 917**: This AS pair is less clear without additional information. However, AS917 (Level 3 Communications) is another instance of AS131477, which could indicate a peering relationship between the two Level 3 networks. This is a common practice for exchanging traffic efficiently.\n\n4. **917 - 60068**: The relationship between AS917 and AS60068 (AT&T) is similar to the previous step, with both being AT&T.

AS65511 (Cable & Wireless) is likely a customer of Level 3, as it's a smaller regional provider. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c).\n\n2. **65511 - 140096**: AS140096 (Vodafone) is a major mobile network operator and a significant player in the telecommunications market. It's common for Tier-1s like Level 3 to provide transit services to mobile operators. The relationship here is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with Level 3 being the provider to Vodafone.\n\n3. **140096 - 917**: AS917 (Vodafone UK) is a subsidiary of Vodafone, operating in the UK market. Given the parent-child relationship, this is a p2c relationship, with AS140096 (Vodafone) being the provider to AS917.\n\n4. **917 - 60068**: AS60068 (BT Group) is another major UK-based telecommunications company, known for its fixed-line and mobile services.

However, it could be a small or private AS that might not have a well-known peering relationship with other major networks.\n\n2. 1273 - This AS is also not a well-known player in the BGP world. It might be a small regional provider or a customer of a larger AS.\n\n3. 58453 - China Mobile International, a large mobile network operator, is likely the provider in this case. It's common for mobile networks to have peering relationships with other mobile operators or with larger ISPs.\n\n4. 9808 - Guangdong Mobile Communication Co., Ltd., another Chinese mobile network, is likely a customer of AS58453, given the similar structure and the ASrank algorithm's inference.\n\n5. 56046 - This AS is again not a well-known AS, but it could be another Chinese mobile network or a smaller ISP.

This could be due to 1299 being a regional provider or a transit point for smaller ASes in the region.\n\n4. 174 - 11776:\nThe ASrank algorithm indicates a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (-1). This might be because 174 is a smaller AS that might be a peer to 11776, or it could be a transit AS that has a direct connection with 11776.\n\n5. 11776 - 49432:\nThe ASrank algorithm again suggests a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (0). This is consistent with the initial p2p relationship between 49432 and 48362, as they might have a direct connection or a mutual agreement.\n\nBased on the ASrank algorithm results, we can infer that 48362 is a provider to both 1299 and 174, while 1299 and 174 are both customers of 48362. 11776 is likely a peer to 174, and 49432 might be a peer to 48362 or have a similar arrangement.\n\nOutput: [\n\"48362-1299: p2c\",\n\"1299-174: p2c\",\n\"174-11776: p2p\",\n\"48362-174: p2c\",\n\"49432-48362: p2p\"\n]",

This suggests a potential provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship, with AS204092 providing services to AS30781.\n\n2. **30781 - 3356**: The relationship between AS30781 and AS3356 (Vodafone Group) is not immediately clear. However, AS3356 is also part of Vodafone, so it's possible that AS30781 is a subsidiary or a regional division of Vodafone, which would maintain a p2c relationship with its parent company.\n\n3. **3356 - 174**: AS3356 (Vodafone Group) is a large multinational telecommunications company, and AS174 (Vodafone Australia) is a subsidiary. This indicates a p2c relationship, with AS3356 providing services to its Australian subsidiary.\n\n4. **174 - 31989**: AS174 (Vodafone Australia) is a regional network, and AS31989 (Optus) is another Australian telecommunications company.

This is a bit unusual, as large providers usually do not have direct peer-to-peer relationships with smaller ASes. However, given the ASrank result, it's possible that there's a specific arrangement or agreement between these two ASes.\n\n2. 15935 - 174:\nThe ASrank algorithm also indicates a peer-to-peer relationship (-1). This could be due to a similar arrangement or a small regional provider-to-customer relationship.\n\n3. 174 - 1299:\nThe ASrank result is -1, suggesting a peer-to-peer relationship. This is consistent with a small regional provider-to-customer relationship, as both ASes might be part of a local network or have a specific agreement.\n\n4. 1299 - 45204:\nThe ASrank result is -1, again indicating a peer-to-peer relationship. This could be due to a similar arrangement or a small regional provider-to-customer relationship.\n\n5. 45204 - 10109:\nThe ASrank result is 0, suggesting a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship. This is more typical for larger ASes like 45204, which might be a transit provider for AS10109.\n\n6. 10109 - 45204:\nThe ASrank result is 0, again indicating a provider-to-customer relationship. This is consistent with 45204's role as a transit provider.\n\n7. 45204 - 15935:\nThe ASrank result is 0, suggesting a peer-to-peer relationship. This could be due to a shared infrastructure or a specific agreement between these two ASes.\n\n8. 15935 - 29504:\nThe ASrank result is 0, which also indicates a peer-to-peer relationship. This might be due to a shared infrastructure or a similar arrangement as in the previous step.\n\nBased on the ASrank results, we can infer that there are multiple peer-to-peer relationships and a few provider-to-customer relationships.

Given AS48858's role as a transit provider, it's likely that AS48858 is providing transit services to AS57304. This would be a provider-to-transit (p2t) relationship.\n\n3. **57304 to 3257**: AS3257 (Vodafone Group) is part of the Vodafone network, which is a multinational telecommunications company.

This aligns with the previous inference that 58453 is a major network.\n\n6. 9808 - 56047:\nThe ASrank result indicates a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship, which could be due to a direct peering agreement between the two ASes or a shared customer.\n\nBased on these inferences, the business relationships are:\n\n- 34800-58057: Transit\n- 58057-50673: Provider-to-customer (p2c) or transit\n- 50673-33891: Transit\n- 33891-58453: Provider-to-customer (p2c)\n- 58453-9808: Provider-to-customer (p2c)\n- 9808-56047: Peer-to-peer (p2p)\n\nOutput: [\"34800-58057: Transit\", \"58057-50673: p2c/Transit\", \"50673-33891: Transit\", \"33891-58453: p2c\", \"58453-9808: p2c\", \"9808-56047: p2p\"]",

This relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS4608 being the provider to AS1221.\n\n2. **1221 - 4637**: AS1221, as a transit provider, would peer with AS4637 (Level 3 Communications) to exchange traffic. This is a common practice for transit providers to interconnect with their peers for efficient routing and peering.\n\n3. **4637 - 701**: AS4637, being a peer of AS1221, would likely have a similar role as a transit provider or a peer to AS701 (Level 3 Communications). The relationship between these two ASes is likely p2p or a peer-to-peer relationship.\n\n4. **701 - 13900**: AS701, another Level 3 Communications AS, is likely a customer of AS13900 (a smaller regional or national ISP). The relationship is again provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS701 being the customer of AS13900.\n\nBased on this analysis, the business relationships in the AS path are:\n- **4608-1221: p2c**\n- **1221-4637: peer**\n- **4637-701: peer**\n- **701-13900: p2c**\n\nOutput:\n[\"4608-1221: p2c\", \"1221-4637: peer\", \"4637-701: peer\", \"701-13900: p2c\"]",

This is because 47251 is a larger AS (likely a Tier-1 or a major provider), and it's more common for such ASes to serve smaller ones.\n\n2. 1299 - 19108:\nThe ASrank algorithm also indicates a provider-to-customer relationship (-1) here. This aligns with the typical hierarchy, where 19108 is a smaller AS that would likely be a customer of 1299.\n\n3. 47251 - 49432:\nThe ASrank algorithm shows a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (0). This could be due to a direct peering agreement between 47251 and 49432, or they might be exchanging traffic through a third AS.\n\n4. 49432 - 48362:\nThe ASrank algorithm again suggests a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (-1). This is likely a result of a peering arrangement between these two ASes.\n\n5. 48362 - 1299:\nThe ASrank algorithm indicates a provider-to-customer relationship (-1) here, which is consistent with the previous inference that 48362 is a smaller AS and 1299 is a larger one.\n\nCombining these results, we can infer the following business relationships:\n\n- 47251-1299: p2c (provider-to-customer)\n- 1299-19108: p2c (provider-to-customer)\n- 47251-49432: p2p (peer-to-peer)\n- 49432-48362: p2p (peer-to-peer)\n- 48362-1299: p2c (provider-to-customer)\n\nOutput: [\"47251-1299: p2c\", \"1299-19108: p2c\", \"47251-49432: p2p\", \"49432-48362: p2p\", \"48362-1299: p2c\"]",

AS15830 (Cable & Wireless) is likely a customer of AS49420, as it's a telecommunications company that might require connectivity to Level 3's network for its services.\n\n2. **15830 to 1299**: This pair doesn't have a clear provider-customer relationship based on the AS numbers alone. It's possible that AS15830 has a peering relationship with AS1299, as both are large telecommunications companies with international presence and might exchange traffic for efficiency.\n\n3. **1299 to 58453**: AS1299 (Vodafone) is a major mobile network operator, and AS58453 (China Mobile International) is a large mobile network in China. This is a likely provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship, with AS1299 providing services to AS58453.\n\n4. **58453 to 9808**: AS58453 (China Mobile International) is again a customer of AS9808 (Guangdong Mobile Communication Co., Ltd.), a mobile network in China.

This could indicate a direct peering agreement between the two ASes, as they have a neutral relationship in the ASrank.\n\n2. 15830 - 1299:\nThe ASrank algorithm also suggests a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (-1). This is consistent with a similar neutral relationship, possibly indicating a bilateral peering arrangement.\n\n3. 15830 - 49420:\nThe ASrank algorithm now shows a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (0). This change suggests that 15830, which is likely a smaller AS, is a customer of 49420, a larger AS with more extensive network resources.\n\n4. 1299 - 58453:\nThe ASrank algorithm indicates a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1), with 1299 being the provider. This aligns with 15830's relationship with 49420, as 1299 could be a smaller AS that 58453, a larger AS, is serving as a customer.\n\n5. 58453 - 9808:\nThe ASrank algorithm again shows a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1), with 58453 being the provider. This is consistent with the previous inference, as 58453 continues to serve as a provider to 9808.\n\nBased on these relationships, we can infer the following business relationships:\n\n- 49420-15830: p2p (likely a direct peering agreement)\n- 15830-1299: p2p (bilateral peering)\n- 15830-49420: p2c (customer relationship)\n- 1299-58453: p2c (provider relationship)\n- 58453-9808: p2c (provider relationship)\n\nOutput: [\n\"49420-15830: p2p\",\n\"15830-1299: p2p\",\n\"15830-49420: p2c\",\n\"1299-58453: p2c\",\n\"58453-9808: p2c\"\n]",

AS65511 (Verizon Business) is likely a customer of Level 3, as CDNs often provide content delivery services to telecommunications companies.\n\n2. **65511 - 140096**: AS140096 (AT&T) is another major telecommunications company. It's possible that AS65511 is a transit provider for AS140096, as AT&T might need to route traffic through Level 3 for access to other networks.\n\n3. **140096 - 917**: This relationship is less clear without additional context. AS917 (Verizon Business) could be a regional provider or a customer of AS140096, as both are owned by Verizon. It might be a p2c (provider-to-customer) relationship or a p2p (peer-to-peer) relationship.\n\n4. **917 - 60068**: AS60068 (AT&T) is again involved, suggesting a potential p2c relationship with AS917. This could be due to traffic routing within the AT&T network.\n\n5. **60068 - 7922**: This pair is less clear, but given the involvement of AT&T, it's possible that AS60068 is a transit provider for AS7922 (Level 3 Communications). This would be a p2c relationship, with Level 3 being the customer.\n\n6. **7922 - 3292**: AS3292 (Cable & Wireless Communications) is a smaller regional provider.

This aligns with the typical business model where a larger AS serves as a transit provider to smaller ASes.\n\n5. 4755 - 17665:\nThe ASrank algorithm shows a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (0). This could be a regular peering arrangement between two similar-sized ASes, or it might be a transit relationship where both ASes are mutually beneficial.\n\n6. 17665 - 55879:\nThe ASrank algorithm suggests a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (-1).

AS15935 (Cable & Wireless) is a UK-based telecommunications company. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS29504 being the provider to AS15935.\n\n2. **15935 to 174**: This AS pair doesn't have a direct connection in the path, but AS15935 is a customer of Level 3, which could mean that 174 (a smaller AS) is also a customer of Level 3. Therefore, the relationship between 15935 and 174 is likely provider-to-customer (p2c) through Level 3.\n\n3. **174 to 64049**: AS174 is a smaller AS, and AS64049 (Vodafone) is a major mobile network operator. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS174 being the provider to AS64049, possibly through a peering relationship or a transit agreement.\n\n4. **64049 to 55836**: AS64049 (Vodafone) is a customer of AS55836 (Vodafone Group), which is the parent company. This is a common practice for large mobile operators to have a direct connection to their parent company for routing and management purposes. The relationship is thus provider-to-customer (p2c) with AS64049 being the customer of AS55836.\n\nBased on this analysis, the business relationships in the AS path are:\n- **29504-15935: p2c**\n- **15935-174: p2c (through Level 3)**\n- **174-64049: p2c**\n- **64049-55836: p2c**\n\nOutput:\n[\"29504-15935: p2c\", \"15935-174: p2c (Level 3)\", \"174-64049: p2c\", \"64049-55836: p2c\"]",

Given the presence of Level 3 (AS23520) in the path, it's possible that AS23520 and AS27947 have a peering relationship, exchanging traffic for efficiency or cost savings.\n\nBased on these observations, the inferred business relationships are:\n\n- 15562-2914: p2c (provider-to-customer, NTT to China Telecom Global)\n- 2914-3491: p2p (peering, NTT to Level 3)\n- 3491-23520: p2p (peering, Level 3 to Level 3)\n- 23520-27947: p2p (peering, Level 3 to AT&T)\n\nPlease note that these are educated guesses, and the actual relationships might be different due to the complexity of BGP routing and the possibility of multiple peering agreements between these ASNs.",

AS12586 (Cable & Wireless Communications) is likely a customer of Level 3, as it's a telecommunications company that requires connectivity to the internet. The relationship is provider-to-customer (p2c).\n\n2. **12586 to 3257**: AS12586 is again the customer, this time to AS3257 (Vodafone Group). Vodafone is a global mobile network operator, and it's common for content providers to have peering agreements with mobile network operators to ensure efficient content delivery. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c).\n\n3. **3257 to 2914**: AS3257, being a mobile network operator, would typically peer with AS2914 (NTT America, Inc.), a major global transit provider. This is a common practice for exchanging traffic and optimizing network performance. The relationship is peer-to-peer (p2p).\n\n4. **2914 to 4761**: AS2914, as a transit provider, would have a peering relationship with AS4761 (Verizon Business), another large provider. The relationship is likely provider-to-peer (p2p) or provider-to-customer (p2c), depending on the specific arrangement.\n\n5. **4761 to 45727**: AS4761, being a major provider, would likely peer with AS45727 (AT&T Business), another large network.

This is because both ASes are likely to be peers, exchanging traffic on a non-settlement basis.\n\n2. 12586 - 3257:\nThe ASrank algorithm indicates a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1) with 12586 being the provider. This is consistent with the idea that larger ASes often serve smaller ones.\n\n3. 3257 - 2914:\nThe ASrank algorithm suggests a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (-1). This could be due to a peering agreement between AS3257 and AS2914, as both are mid-sized networks.\n\n4. 2914 - 4761:\nThe ASrank algorithm indicates a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1), with AS2914 being the provider. This aligns with AS2914's role as a major transit provider.\n\n5. 4761 - 45727:\nThe ASrank algorithm suggests a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (-1).

This is consistent with the previous pair, where 1299 could be a smaller network that relies on 6855 for transit.\n\n5. 6855 - 58239:\nThe ASrank algorithm also suggests a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1). This is again in line with the pattern, where 6855 is likely a transit provider for 58239.\n\nBased on the ASrank results, we can infer that there are multiple peer-to-peer relationships, which could be for various reasons like direct peering, traffic exchange, or local routing. The provider-to-customer relationships suggest that some ASes are transit providers for others, with 3491 and 6855 being the most likely candidates.\n\nOutput: [\n\"55720-3491: p2p\",\n\"3491-1299: p2p\",\n\"3491-55720: p2c (transit possibility, but not confirmed)\",\n\"1299-6855: p2c\",\n\"6855-58239: p2c\"\n]",

Therefore, it's possible they have a p2p (peer-to-peer) relationship.\n\n2. 30781 - 2914:\nAS2914 (NTT Communications) is a major transit provider, so it's likely that 30781, a smaller AS, is a customer of NTT. This would be a p2c (provider-to-customer) relationship.\n\n3. 2914 - 7552:\nAgain, without specific ASrank information, it's possible that 7552 is a customer of AS2914, given its position after a major provider. This would be another p2c relationship.\n\n4. 7552 - 24086:\nThe ASrank algorithm couldn't infer this pair, but it's common for smaller ASes to peer with each other for regional connectivity or peering.

However, given that 4608 is China Telecom, a major global provider, and 7575 is Macquarie Telecom, a smaller Australian ISP, it's more likely that 7575 is a customer of 4608. This is because China Telecom would typically route traffic to smaller regional networks.\n\n2. 7575 - 57463:\nThis pair could also be p2c, as 57463 (Vodafone Australia) is another regional ISP. The relationship is likely based on a peering agreement, as both ASes are in the same region and would benefit from direct traffic exchange.\n\n3. 57463 - 196925:\nThis pair is likely p2c, as 196925 (Optus, another Australian ISP) would be a customer of Vodafone Australia for access to their network.\n\n4. 196925 - 203622:\nThis pair could be p2p, as both ASes are Australian and might have a mutual peering arrangement to optimize their routing and reduce transit costs.\n\n5. 203622 - 205547:\nThis pair is again p2p, as 203622 (Telstra) and 205547 (another Australian ISP) are likely peers, exchanging traffic on a settlement-free basis.\n\nBased on the analysis, the inferred business relationships are:\n\n- 4608-7575: p2c (China Telecom to Macquarie Telecom)\n- 7575-57463: p2p (Macquarie Telecom to Vodafone Australia)\n- 57463-196925: p2c (Vodafone Australia to Optus)\n- 196925-203622: p2p (Optus to Telstra)\n- 203622-205547: p2p (Telstra to another Australian ISP)\n\nPlease note that these are educated guesses based on the given information, and the actual relationships might differ due to various factors like direct peering, transit agreements, or network architecture.",

This could be due to a similar scenario as in the previous step, where the relationship is more of a mutual peer relationship.\n\n3. 6939 - 34854:\nThe ASrank algorithm suggests a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (0). This is a bit unusual, but it could be because 6939 is a smaller AS and 34854 is a larger AS that might be providing transit services to 6939.\n\n4. 1299 - 58453:\nThe ASrank algorithm suggests a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1).

Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **29504 - 15935**: \n   - AS29504 (Level 3 Communications) is a large CDN (Content Delivery Network) provider. It's likely that 15935 (Verizon Business) is a customer of Level 3, as CDNs often provide content delivery services to telecommunications companies.\n\n2. **15935 - 174**: \n   - The AS path doesn't provide enough information to determine a clear relationship between these two ASNs. However, given the context, 174 (AT&T) might be a customer of 15935, as AT&T is a major telecommunications company that could benefit from CDN services.\n\n3. **174 - 5511**: \n   - The relationship between 174 (AT&T) and 5511 (Level 3 Communications) is not immediately clear. It could be a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship, as both are large CDN providers and might have peering agreements to optimize their content delivery.\n\n4. **5511 - 24863**: \n   - AS24863 (Cable & Wireless Communications) is another CDN provider. The relationship between 5511 and 24863 could be p2p, as CDNs often peer with other CDNs to share content and reduce transit costs.\n\nBased on the ASrank algorithm's inability to infer, we can't be certain about the exact business relationships. However, the general pattern suggests a mix of provider-to-customer (p2c) and peer-to-peer (p2p) relationships. Here's a summary of the inferred business relationships:\n\n- **29504-15935: p2c (Level 3 to Verizon Business)** \n- **15935-174: potential p2c (AT&T to Level 3, but could also be a CDN customer)** \n- **174-5511: p2p (CDN peers)** \n- **5511-24863: p2p (CDN peers)**\n\nOutput: [\"29504-15935: p2c\", \"15935-174: potential p2c\", \"174-5511: p2p\", \"5511-24863: p2p\"]",

AS59919 (Cable & Wireless) is likely a smaller regional or national provider. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS57463 serving as the provider to AS59919.\n\n2. **57463 - 29049**: AS29049 (Vodafone) is another Tier-1 ISP and a significant player in the international market. Given AS57463's role as a transit provider, it's possible that AS57463 is providing transit services to AS29049.

AS57821 is likely a smaller AS that needs to access the global internet through Level 3. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS6939 being the provider to AS57821.\n\n2. **6939 to 1299**: This pair is less clear without additional information. It could be a peering relationship, as both ASes are likely to have similar capabilities and exchange traffic directly. However, without ASrank or additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the relationship.\n\n3. **1299 to 58453**: AS58453 (China Mobile International) is a large mobile network operator, and AS1299 is likely a smaller regional or national provider. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS1299 being the provider to AS58453.\n\n4. **58453 to 9808**: AS9808 (Guangdong Mobile Communication Co., Ltd.) is another large mobile network in China, and AS58453 is part of the China Mobile group. This relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS58453 being the provider to AS9808.\n\n5. **9808 to 24547**: AS24547 (Level 3 Communications) is another transit provider, similar to AS6939. This could be a peering relationship, as both ASes are likely to have a mutual interest in exchanging traffic efficiently. The relationship is likely p2p (peer-to-peer).\n\nBased on this analysis, the business relationships in the AS path are:\n- **57821-6939: p2c**\n- **6939-1299: potential peering**\n- **1299-58453: p2c**\n- **58453-9808: p2c**\n- **9808-24547: p2p**\n\nOutput:\n[\"57821-6939: p2c\", \"6939-1299: potential peering\", \"1299-58453: p2c\", \"58453-9808: p2c\", \"9808-24547: p2p\"]",

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact provider-customer relationship.\n\n2. 6939 - 1299: This pair might also be a p2c relationship, as smaller ASes often peer with larger ones for transit or peering. However, without further details, it's speculative.\n\n3. 1299 - 58453: This could be a p2c relationship, with 58453 (China Mobile International) being a major mobile network provider and 1299 potentially a customer or a smaller regional provider.\n\n4. 58453 - 9808: This is likely a p2c relationship, as 9808 (Guangdong Mobile Communication Co., Ltd.) is another major mobile network in China, and China Mobile International would typically provide services to its subsidiaries.\n\n5. 9808 - 24547: This pair could be a p2p relationship, as both ASes are likely to have similar roles and might be exchanging traffic for peering or transit purposes.\n\nBased on the ASrank algorithm's inability to infer, it's possible that these ASes are part of a larger network or have complex relationships that are not immediately apparent from the AS paths alone.

AS34927 is likely a smaller AS that connects to Level 3 for access to the global internet. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS174 being the provider to AS34927.\n\n2. **174 to 3356**: AS3356 (Cable & Wireless) is another Tier-1 ISP, known for its international connectivity. It's possible that AS174 is providing transit services to AS3356, or they might have a peering relationship. The relationship could be either p2c (provider-to-customer) or p2p (peer-to-peer).\n\n3. **3356 to 7195**: AS7195 (Vodafone) is a large mobile network operator, which typically has peering relationships with other mobile operators and possibly with Tier-1 ISPs for interconnectivity.

It's likely that AS22652 is a smaller provider or a customer of Level 3. The relationship could be either p2c (provider-to-customer) or p2p (peer-to-peer), depending on the specific arrangement.\n\n2. **174 - 3356**: AS3356 (Cable & Wireless) is another large telecommunications company, primarily operating in Europe. Given the size and scope of both AS174 and AS3356, it's possible that they have a peering relationship, exchanging traffic on a settlement-free basis.\n\n3. **3356 - 20940**: This pair is less clear without additional context.

AS15935 (Cable & Wireless) is a UK-based telecommunications company. This relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS29504 providing services to AS15935.\n\n2. **15935 to 174**: The AS path doesn't have a clear provider-customer relationship as AS174 (Vodafone) is a mobile network operator and might have peering agreements with multiple providers. This could be a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship or a transit relationship.\n\n3. **174 to 3356**: AS174 (Vodafone) is again involved, and AS3356 (Telenor) is another mobile network operator. Given the nature of mobile networks, it's likely that both AS174 and AS3356 have peering agreements with each other for efficient traffic exchange, which is a common practice in the industry.\n\n4. **3356 to 131429**: AS3356 (Telenor) is a Norwegian mobile network, and AS131429 (Telia Norge AS) is also a Norwegian mobile operator. Both are part of the same company, Telia, which operates in multiple countries. This relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c) within the Telia group.\n\nBased on this analysis, the business relationships in the AS path are:\n- **29504-15935: p2c**\n- **15935-174: p2p (or transit)**\n- **174-3356: p2p (peering)**\n- **3356-131429: p2c (within Telia group)**\n\nOutput:\n[\"29504-15935: p2c\", \"15935-174: p2p\", \"174-3356: p2p\", \"3356-131429: p2c\"]",

Without more information, it's difficult to determine the exact relationship.\n\n2. **206499** - This AS number is also not well-known, but it's likely a smaller regional player or a peer with AS202365. The ASrank algorithm doesn't provide specific information here, but the peer relationship is inferred based on the typical routing patterns.\n\n3. **34549** - This AS is a smaller regional provider, often acting as a customer to larger networks. The ASrank algorithm doesn't provide a direct relationship, but the path suggests a customer-to-provider relationship.\n\n4. **8966** - This AS is a transit AS, which means it connects multiple networks and forwards traffic to larger ones. It's likely a transit provider to AS34549, as it's the next hop in the path.\n\n5. **5384** - Another transit AS, it's likely a transit provider to AS8966, as it's the next hop in the path.\n\n6. **202024** - This AS is again not well-known, but it could be a customer of AS5384 or a peer. The ASrank algorithm doesn't provide a clear relationship, but the path suggests a customer-to-provider or peer relationship.\n\nBased on the analysis, the inferred business relationships are:\n\n- **202365-206499**: Peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship, as both ASes are likely smaller regional players.\n- **206499-34549**: Provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship, with AS206499 being the provider to AS34549.\n- **34549-8966**: Customer-to-provider (c2p) relationship, with AS34549 being the customer to AS8966.\n- **8966-5384**: Provider-to-transit (p2t) relationship, with AS8966 being the provider to AS5384.\n- **5384-202024**: Customer-to-provider (c2p) or peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship, depending on the specific relationship between AS5384 and AS202024.\n\nOutput: [\"202365-206499: p2p\", \"206499-34549: p2c\", \"34549-8966: c2p\", \"8966-5384: p2t\", \"5384-202024: c2p/p2p\"]",

Here's my attempt to infer the business relationships:\n\n1. 202365 - 206499:\nThis pair doesn't have a clear provider-customer relationship based on the AS numbers alone. However, AS206499 (Level 3 Communications) is a well-known Tier-1 ISP and a major transit provider. It's possible that AS202365 is a smaller AS that has a peering relationship with Level 3, or it could be a customer of a different AS that has a peering arrangement with Level 3.\n\n2. 206499 - 34549:\nThis pair could be a provider-to-customer relationship, with AS206499 (Level 3) providing transit to AS34549 (a smaller regional or national ISP). Level 3 is known to have extensive peering relationships, so this is a plausible scenario.\n\n3. 34549 - 8966:\nAgain, without specific information, it's difficult to determine the exact relationship. However, AS8966 (Vodafone) is a large telecommunications company, and AS34549 could be a customer or a peer, given Vodafone's global presence and peering activities.\n\n4. 8966 - 5384:\nThis pair could be a peer-to-peer relationship, as both ASes are large telecommunications companies with extensive networks. They might have a mutual peering agreement to optimize their routing and reduce transit costs.\n\n5. 5384 - 202024:\nThis pair could be a provider-to-customer relationship, with AS5384 (Telecom Italia) providing transit to AS202024 (a smaller regional or national ISP). Telecom Italia is known to have a significant presence in Europe and could serve smaller networks in the region.\n\nIn summary, the inferred business relationships are:\n- 202365-206499: Potential peering or customer relationship with Level 3\n- 206499-34549: Provider-to-customer, Level 3 to AS34549\n- 34549-8966: Customer or peer relationship with Vodafone\n- 8966-5384: Peer-to-peer relationship\n- 5384-202024: Provider-to-customer, Telecom Italia to AS202024\n\nPlease note that these are educated guesses based on the AS numbers and their typical roles in the BGP routing landscape, and the actual relationships might be different.",

It's possible that AS58057 is a customer of AS34800, as Level 3 often provides services to other carriers.\n\n2. **58057 - 50673**: The ASrank algorithm doesn't provide specific information here, but AS50673 (Vodafone Group) is again the same company as AS58057. This suggests a potential peering relationship, as Vodafone would likely peer with itself to optimize its network and reduce transit costs.\n\n3. **50673 - 174**: This pair is less clear, but AS174 (Level 3 Communications) is the same company as AS34800. This could indicate a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship, where AS174 (Level 3) is providing services to itself, or it might be a loop within the company's network.\n\n4. **174 - 6461**: AS6461 (Abovenet Communications) is a smaller ISP. Given that AS174 is also Level 3, it's possible that AS6461 is a customer of AS174, as smaller networks often rely on larger providers for transit.\n\n5. **6461 - 18734**: The ASrank algorithm doesn't provide a clear inference here, but AS18734 (Telenor AS) is a Norwegian telecommunications company. It's likely that AS6461 is a customer of AS18734, as Telenor often has customer relationships with other carriers in the region.\n\nBased on these observations, the inferred business relationships are:\n\n- **34800-58057: p2c (customer relationship between Level 3 and Vodafone Group)**\n- **58057-50673: p2p (Vodafone Group peering with itself)**\n- **50673-174: p2c (Level 3 providing services to itself)**\n- **174-6461: p2c (Level 3 providing services to Abovenet)**\n- **6461-18734: p2c (Abovenet likely a customer of Telenor AS)**\n\nOutput: [\"34800-58057: p2c\", \"58057-50673: p2p\", \"50673-174: p2c\", \"174-6461: p2c\", \"6461-18734: p2c\"]",

This is a common practice for ASes that have a direct connection or a mutual agreement to exchange traffic.\n\n2. 58057 - 50673:\nThe ASrank algorithm indicates a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1) with 58057 being the provider. This aligns with the typical role of a larger AS providing services to smaller ones.\n\n3. 50673 - 174:\nThe ASrank algorithm suggests a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1) with 50673 being the provider. This is consistent with the pattern established in the previous step.\n\n4. 174 - 6461:\nThe ASrank algorithm indicates a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (0). This could be due to a direct connection or a mutual agreement between ASes with similar sizes.\n\n5. 6461 - 18734:\nThe ASrank algorithm suggests a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (-1). This is again a p2p relationship, which might be due to a direct connection or a mutual agreement.\n\n6. 18734 - 34800:\nThe ASrank algorithm does not provide a clear inference for this pair, but given the pattern of p2p relationships, it's possible that 18734 is also a peer to 34800.\n\nBased on the ASrank results, we can infer that there are multiple p2p relationships and a few p2c relationships.

This is interesting, as AS3356 is usually a smaller player, and a provider to a larger AS like 58453 would be unusual.

This could be a p2c relationship, with AS3491 providing transit services to AT&T.\n\n4. **9924 to 38841**: AS38841 (Verizon Business) is another US-based carrier, and it's common for transit providers like AS9924 to have peering relationships with similar networks. This could be a p2p relationship, where both AS9924 and AS38841 exchange traffic on a peer-to-peer basis.\n\nBased on this analysis, the business relationships in the AS path are:\n- **15562-2914: p2c**\n- **2914-3491: p2p (or p2c, uncertain due to ASrank)**\n- **3491-9924: p2c (or p2p, uncertain due to ASrank)**\n- **9924-38841: p2p**\n\nOutput:\n[\"15562-2914: p2c\", \"2914-3491: p2p/p2c (uncertain)\", \"3491-9924: p2c/p2p (uncertain)\", \"9924-38841: p2p\"]",

AS22652 is likely a smaller AS that connects to Level 3 for access to the global internet. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS174 being the provider to AS22652.\n\n2. **174 to 6762**: AS6762 (Cable & Wireless) is another Tier-1 ISP, known for its international connectivity. It's possible that AS174 is providing transit services to AS6762, or they might be peers exchanging traffic. The relationship could be either p2p or p2c, depending on their specific peering arrangements.\n\n3. **6762 to 49666**: AS49666 (Vodafone) is a large mobile network operator and a significant player in the telecommunications industry. Given AS6762's Tier-1 status, it's likely that AS6762 is providing transit services to AS49666, or they are peers. The relationship is again p2c or p2p.\n\n4. **49666 to 41689**: AS41689 (Telenor) is another mobile network operator, similar to AS49666.

This is consistent with the idea that both ASes might be peers, possibly exchanging traffic or having a direct connection.\n\n2. 2914 - 1299:\nThe ASrank algorithm indicates a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1) with 2914 being the provider. This aligns with the role of a major transit provider like NTT Communications, which is likely to serve smaller networks like 1299.\n\n3. 1299 - 12849:\nThe ASrank algorithm suggests a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (-1).

Here's my attempt to infer the business relationships:\n\n1. 204092 - 30781:\nThis pair doesn't have a clear provider-customer relationship based on the AS numbers alone. However, AS30781 (Level 3 Communications) is a well-known Tier-1 ISP and transit provider. It's possible that AS204092 is a smaller regional provider or a customer of Level 3 for peering or transit services.\n\n2. 30781 - 3356:\nAgain, without specific information, it's hard to determine the exact relationship. However, AS3356 (Cable & Wireless) is another Tier-1 ISP. It's likely that AS30781 and AS3356 are peers, exchanging traffic on a settlement-free basis.\n\n3. 3356 - 20804:\nThis pair could be a customer-customer relationship, with AS3356 providing services to AS20804. However, without more context, it's difficult to confirm.\n\n4. 20804 - 215985:\nAS215985 (Level 3 Communications) is another instance of Level 3, which is a known transit provider. It's possible that AS20804 is a customer of Level 3 for transit services or a peer for peering.\n\nBased on the ASrank algorithm's inability to infer, it's likely that these relationships are either peering or transit, with some level of uncertainty due to the lack of specific information.

This could be due to a similar scenario as in step 1, where AS18351 and AS56245 have a direct peering agreement.\n\nCombining these results, we can infer the following business relationships:\n\n- 132825-4635: p2p (likely a direct peering agreement)\n- 4635-6939: p2c (4635 as a provider to 6939)\n- 6939-18351: p2c (6939 as a customer of 4635)\n- 18351-56245: p2p (likely a direct peering agreement)\n\nOutput: [\"132825-4635: p2p\", \"4635-6939: p2c\", \"6939-18351: p2c\", \"18351-56245: p2p\"]",

The relationship is likely peer-to-peer (p2p).\n\n2. **206499 - 50629**: AS50629 (Level 3 Communications) is a large content distribution network (CDN) provider. It's likely that 206499, being a smaller AS, is a customer of 50629 to access its CDN services.\n\n3. **50629 - 2914**: AS2914 (NTT America, Inc.) is a major global provider known for its extensive peering and customer base. AS50629, being a CDN provider, would typically peer with or route traffic to AS2914 for better access to global content. This is a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship.\n\n4. **2914 - 51847**: AS51847 (AT&T) is another major global provider. Given AS2914's role as a transit point, it's likely that 51847 is a customer of 2914, seeking access to its extensive network. This is a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship.\n\n5. **51847 - 64050**: AS64050 (Verizon Business) is another large provider. Similar to the previous step, AS51847 would likely route traffic to AS64050 for access to its network.

This is a common practice for smaller networks that don't have a significant transit relationship.\n\n2. 24961 - 3356:\nThe ASrank algorithm suggests a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1), with 24961 being the provider.

This further supports the idea that 58453 is a customer of 3356.\n\n4. 58453 - 9808:\nThe ASrank algorithm indicates a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship (-1), with 58453 being the provider. This aligns with the previous inference that 58453 is a larger network providing transit to 9808.\n\n5. 9808 - 24444:\nThe ASrank algorithm suggests a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (0).

AS58057 is likely a smaller AS that connects to AS174 for access to the global internet. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS174 being the provider to AS58057.\n\n2. **174 to 29169**: AS29169 (Cable & Wireless) is another Tier-1 ISP, known for its international connectivity. It's possible that AS174 is also providing transit to AS29169, or they have a peering relationship.

However, AS58057 (Level 3 Communications) is a large telecommunications company, and AS174 (Optus) is an Australian telecommunications company. It's possible that they have a peering relationship, but without more specific data, it's difficult to determine.\n\n2. 174 - 29169:\nAS174 (Optus) is likely a customer of AS29169 (Cable & Wireless Communications, now known as Virgin Media). This is because Cable & Wireless was a major telecommunications provider in the UK and had a customer base similar to Optus.\n\n3. 29169 - 20766:\nThis pair doesn't have a clear relationship from the ASrank algorithm. However, AS29169 (Virgin Media) is a UK-based provider, and AS20766 (Vodafone) is another major UK mobile network. They might have a peering agreement to exchange traffic efficiently.\n\n4. 20766 - 207816:\nThe ASrank algorithm doesn't provide a relationship here either. However, AS20766 (Vodafone) and AS207816 (Vodafone Group) are likely part of the same organization, as Vodafone is a multinational telecommunications company. This would suggest a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship, with AS20766 being the provider to AS207816.\n\nBased on these inferences, the business relationships could be:\n- 58057-174: p2p (peering)\n- 174-29169: p2c (customer)\n- 29169-20766: p2p (peering, or potential customer)\n- 20766-207816: p2c (within the same organization)\n\nOutput: [\"58057-174: p2p\", \"174-29169: p2c\", \"29169-20766: p2p (or p2c)\", \"20766-207816: p2c\"]",

However, the ASrank might be influenced by a specific transit arrangement or a direct peering relationship.\n\n5. 4780 - 17709:\nThe ASrank algorithm indicates a p2c relationship (-1), which could be due to 4780 (Level 3 Communications) being a transit provider for 17709 (Cable & Wireless Communications).

However, without additional context, it's difficult to confirm.\n\n2. 49432 - 48362:\nThis pair might also be a p2p relationship, as both ASes are smaller and could be part of a regional peering agreement. The ASrank algorithm's inability to infer a clear relationship suggests that they might be exchanging traffic on a peer-to-peer basis.\n\n3. 48362 - 6939:\nThis could be a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship, with AS48362 (a smaller AS) providing transit to AS6939 (a potentially smaller customer). However, without more information, this is speculative.\n\n4. 6939 - 803:\nThis pair might be a p2c relationship, with AS6939 being a customer of AS803, which could be a larger transit provider or a regional provider.\n\n5. 803 - 399844:\nThis could be a p2c relationship, with AS803 (a potential transit provider) providing services to AS399844 (a larger AS).

However, AS202365 (Level 3 Communications) is a large content and cloud provider, while AS50673 (Cable & Wireless Communications) is a UK-based telecommunications company. It's possible that they have a peering relationship, exchanging traffic efficiently.\n\n2. 50673 - 174:\nThis pair doesn't have a direct ASrank inference, but 174 (Vodafone) is a major telecommunications company with a global presence. It's likely that they have a peering relationship with AS50673, as they often establish peering agreements to optimize their network traffic.\n\n3. 58453 - 9808:\nAS58453 (China Mobile International) is a large mobile network, and AS9808 (Guangdong Mobile Communication Co., Ltd.) is another mobile network in China.

AS131477 is likely a smaller AS that connects to AS65511 for access to the global internet. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c).\n\n2. **65511 - 140096**: AS140096 (Cable & Wireless) is another Tier-1 ISP, known for its international connectivity. Given AS65511's role as a transit provider, it's likely that AS140096 is a customer of AS65511. The relationship is again provider-to-customer (p2c).\n\n3. **140096 - 917**: AS917 (Vodafone) is a mobile network operator, which typically does not have direct peering relationships with Tier-1 ISPs. Instead, it would likely route traffic through its Tier-1 provider, AS140096. This indicates a provider-to-customer relationship (p2c).\n\n4. **917 - 60068**: AS60068 (Vodafone) is again AS917, but listed twice in the path. This suggests a loop in the routing, which could be due to a routing error or a specific configuration. The relationship between these ASes is unclear, but it's not a typical business relationship.\n\n5. **60068 - 174**: AS174 (Level 3 Communications) is another instance of AS60068, which again indicates a routing loop.

This indicates a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship, with AS2914 serving as the provider to AS15562.\n\n2. **2914 to 3356**: AS3356 (Level 3 Communications) is another major transit provider, likely providing connectivity to AS2914. This could be a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship, as both ASes are major transit providers and might exchange traffic for efficiency or peering benefits.\n\n3. **3356 to 209**: AS209 (Verizon Business) is a large US-based ISP, which might be a customer of AS3356 for international connectivity. This is a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship, with AS3356 being the provider to AS209.\n\n4. **209 to 721**: AS721 (AT&T) is another US-based ISP, and it's likely that AS209 is a customer of AS721 for its US-based services. This is another provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship.\n\n5. **721 to 27064**: AS27064 (Telia Norge AS) is a Norwegian ISP. Given that AS721 is a US-based provider, it's less likely to have a direct customer relationship with AS27064. However, it's possible that AS721 is a transit provider for AS27064, which would be a p2c relationship, with AS721 providing transit services to AS27064.\n\nBased on this analysis, the business relationships in the AS path are:\n- **15562-2914: p2c**\n- **2914-3356: p2p**\n- **3356-209: p2c**\n- **209-721: p2c**\n- **721-27064: p2c (transit)**\n\nOutput:\n[\"15562-2914: p2c\", \"2914-3356: p2p\", \"3356-209: p2c\", \"209-721: p2c\", \"721-27064: p2c (transit)\"]",

This aligns with the typical hierarchy where larger providers serve smaller customers.\n\n4. 209 - 721:\nThe ASrank algorithm indicates a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (-1). This could be due to a direct peering agreement between the two ASes, as they have a similar size and might not be part of a larger provider-customer relationship.\n\n5. 721 - 27064:\nThe ASrank algorithm suggests a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (-1) again. This is likely a result of a direct peering relationship between AS721 and AS27064.\n\n6. 2914 - 15562:\nThe ASrank algorithm indicates a peer-to-peer (p2p) relationship (0), which is a reversal from the previous step.

They might have a mutual peering agreement to exchange traffic efficiently.\n\n4. 7018 - 40886:\nAS40886 (Telenor) is another telecommunications company, likely a customer of AS7018. The ASrank algorithm's inability to infer a relationship could be due to the fact that these ASes might be part of a larger group or have a complex routing setup.\n\nBased on these observations, the inferred business relationships are:\n\n- **44103-57866**: Potential p2c (provider-to-customer) or p2p relationship, with AS57866 being the provider or peer.\n- **57866-1299**: p2c, with AS57866 providing transit services to AS1299.\n- **1299-7018**: p2p, likely a mutual peering agreement.\n- **7018-40886**: p2c, with AS7018 being the customer of AS40886.\n\nOutput: [\"44103-57866: [Potential p2c, p2p]\", \"57866-1299: p2c\", \"1299-7018: p2p\", \"7018-40886: p2c\"]",

AS47251 is likely a smaller AS that connects to Level 3 for access to the global internet. The relationship is likely provider-to-customer (p2c), with AS49432 being the provider to AS47251.\n\n2. **49432 to 48362**: AS48362 (Cable & Wireless) is another Tier-1 ISP, known for its international connectivity. Given AS49432's position as a transit provider, it's possible that AS48362 is a customer of AS49432. This would be a provider-to-customer (p2c) relationship.\n\n3. **48362 to 1299**: AS1299 (Vodafone) is a large mobile network operator, which typically has peering relationships with other mobile operators and possibly with Tier-1 ISPs for interconnectivity.
